### Lineage

Inspired by the incredible work of [TheTrain](https://github.com/TheTrainGoes) on the [OpenStickCommunity Fightstick
Case](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/Fightstick%20Case), itself based on the incredible work
by [Dash n'Mash](https://twitter.com/Dash_xx_Mash?s=20). Original work Copyright 2023 TheTrain, [licensed under CC BY

### Distributing BSS Sticks

Under the terms of the GPLv3, you must inform the receiver of the "object code" of their rights under the GPLv3. This is
a bit of a gray area for physical objects, but likely applies to distribution of modified or unmodified STL, STEP, etc.
files at a minimum. The easiest way to satisfy the GPLv3 in either situation is to provide a link to the source code
(either the unmodified mainline project, or your copy, with modifications listed in a "prominent notice"); something
like the below should suffice in either electronic or printed form:

> This arcade stick is part of the Buildable Stick System, version X.Y.Z; the source code to this program is available
> under the terms of the GNU General Public License, at [LINK].
